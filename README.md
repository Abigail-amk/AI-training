## 📋 Project Description

This project explores fine-tuning the Phi-3 Mini model from Microsoft. The focus is to create an effective programming assistant that teaches you development best practices. By using PEFT (LoRA) and 4-bit quantization with BitsAndBytes, the model adjusts efficiently, requiring only a small portion of its total parameters for training.
